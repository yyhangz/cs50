Prompt user for key using CLI
Check if there are 2 strings inputted by user, if there isnt, print Usage ./caesar key and return 1 to main function
Check if ith character of key input is a numerical digit, where i is initially 1
Repeat step 3 for times equal to the string length, increasing i by 1 everytime its repeated  
Should step 3 ever return FALSE, print Usage ./caesar key and return 1 to main function, terminating caesar.c
Should step 5 not occur, convert the string of digits into an integer and store in variable called key
Prompt user for plain text
Check if ith character of the string is lower, upper, and if they are, encrypt it and print encrypted character(i = 1 intially)
If not, just print character as it is
Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the length of string, but increase i by 1 each time
