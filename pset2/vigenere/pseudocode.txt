Prompt user for keyword using CLI
Check if there are 2 strings inputted by user, if there isnt, print Usage ./vigenere keyword and return 1 to main function
Check if ith character of keyword input is an alphabet, where i is initially 1
Repeat step 3 for times equal to the string length, increasing i by 1 everytime its repeated  
Should step 3 ever return FALSE, print Usage ./vigenere keyword and return 1 to main function, terminating vigenere.c
Prompt user for plain text
Check if ith character of the plain text is lower or upper case alphabets, or none
If they are alphabets, encrypt it using switch function(i = 1 intially), print encrypted character and move to next key letter
If not, just print character as it is
Repeat steps 7 to 9 for the length of string, but increase i by 1 each time
